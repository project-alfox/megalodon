## Frontend

Represents the user facing aspects that the user sees and interacts with.

If you're hacking on the _frontend_, and not really touching the backend a lot.
```bash
$ ./gradlew bootRun
$ npm start
```

If you're hacking on the _backend_
```bash
$ npm run build
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

Notice the different *order* of commands.
